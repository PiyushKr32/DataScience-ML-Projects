## Some project that i worked on showcasing EDA and various machine learning models and techniques:trophy:

**Statistical & Probabilistic Analysis of Store Sales, University Survey, & Manufacturing data** â€“ The project involved drawing inferences from 3 case studies, namely - Wholesale Customer Data (Store Sales), University Survey Data & Manufacturing Shingles Data. The concepts of various measures of Descriptive Statistics, Probability and Probability Distributions, and various Estimation & Hypothesis Testing measures are used to analyze these case studies.

**Salary Analysis using ANOVA and Principal Component Analysis on College Admissions Data** - The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Salary Analysis, College Admissions Data. The concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis, Analysis of Variance, and Principal Component Analysis are used to draw inferences from these case studies.

**Bank Customer Segmentation and Insurance Claim Prediction Data** - The project involved drawing inferences from 2 case studies, namely - Bank Marketing & Insurance. The concepts of Clustering, CART, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network are used to draw inferences from these case studies. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.

**Gems & Holiday Package Prediction Data** - This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction. In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. In the second case, concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base.

**Election Exit Poll Prediction and U.S.A Presidential Speech Analysis using Machine Learning** - This project is based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. The first project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted. The second project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. One has to draw inferences based on the analysis done on these speeches.

**Built a model to Forecast monthly sales of Wine for certain Wine Estate for the next 12 month** - Analyzed historical monthly sales data of a company. Created multiple forecast models for two different products of a particular Wine Estate and recommended the optimum forecasting model to predict monthly sales for the next 12 months along with appropriate lower and upper confidence limits
