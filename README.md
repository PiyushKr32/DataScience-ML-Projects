Some project that i worked on including EDA and various machine learning models and techniques.

Model Performance Project – Performed 1-Way ANOVA and 2-Way ANOVA on dataset of salaries of various individuals to analyse the dependency with respect to salary with different variables in dataset. Testing multiple ML algorithms and accessing performance of each model, hyper parameter tuning of each model to select the best model for production dataset prediction analysis. 

Data Mining Project – Performed unsupervised clustering methods on bank marketing dataset to analyse the different groups present in the dataset. Performed supervised learning methods on insurance dataset to predict the claim status and provide recommendation to management to reduce the frequency of claims.

Predictive Modelling Project – Working with a Gem stone company dataset in predicting the price for the stone on the bases of the details given in the dataset so it can distinguish between higher profitable stones and lower profitable stones so as to have better profit share. Performed LDA and logistic regression techniques on Tour and Travel company dataset to focus on particular clients to sell their holiday packages.

	Machine Learning Project – Project based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. The first project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted. The second project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. One has to draw inferences based on the analysis done on these speeches.
